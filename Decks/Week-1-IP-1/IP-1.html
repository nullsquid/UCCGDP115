					<h1>Part 1: What is Intellectual Property?</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Kinds of IP</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Copyright</li>
						<li class="fragment">Trade Secrets</li>
						<li class="fragment">Trademarks</li>
						<li class="fragment">Patents</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Part 2: Copyright</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is Copyright</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">No one can use the stuff you make for your game</li>
						<li class="fragment">Comes into effect as soon as material is made</li>
						<li class="fragment">Can be registered</li>
						<li class="fragment">Most approachable and financially accessible for of IP protection</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How does it apply to games?</h2>
					<table class="fragment">
						<tr>
							<td><strong>You can copyright</strong></td>
							<td>Code</td>
							<td>Art</td>
							<td>Names</td>
							<td>Logos</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><strong>You cannot copyright</strong></td>
							<td>Mechanics</td>
							<td>Ideas</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What are the limits of Copyright</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">As an indie, it can be hard to expensive to enforce</li>
						<li class="fragment">Your work needs to be <em>made material</em> before copyright comes into effect</li>
						<li class="fragment">After a certain period of time, Copyrighted works enter the public domain</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Using Work Someone Else Made First</h2>
					<p>If you want to use someone else's work in your original work, you must either</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Pay them to license it</li>
						<li class="fragment">Use work in the public domain</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Licenses</h2>
					<p class="fragment">In order to use an author's work when it is not in the public domain, you must pay the creator for a license</p>
					<p class="fragment">Licensing can get very weird in games, and is usually prohibitively expensive for indies</p>
					<p class="fragment">Often, specific material iterations of a work are licensed differently</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Licenses: An Example</h2>
					<p class="fragment">The book and film versions of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> have different licenses associated with them</p>
					<p class="fragment">A <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> game was released in 2002 by Vivendi Universal using the book license, and therefore could not include any of the likenesses of the actors from the film, even though it existed at that time</p>
					<p class="fragment">Electronic Arts, however, had the film license and made game tie ins for the two films that came after <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Public Domain Works</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Once a Copyrighted work has exised for the life of the author + 70 years (depending on publication date), it enters the public domain</p>
					<p class="fragment">This means that you can use said work or any elements from it without a license</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Considerations With Public Domain Works</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Copyright laws vary from country to country</li>
						<li class="fragment">As with works not in the public domain, a <em>work or piece of a work</em> can be in the public domain but a specific implementation of them might be copyrighted</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment"><small>e.g. you can make a Sherlock Holmes game without paying for the rights but not a <em>BBC's Sherlock</em> game</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fair Use</h2>
					<p class="fragment">In America, there are allowances for use of small pieces of Copyrighted works under what's known as <strong>Fair Use</strong></p>
					<p class="fragment">To claim fair use, your work must substantially transform the original work (e.g. be educational or parody in nature) and use only a very small piece of it</p>
					<p class="fragment"><strong>Fair Use is a defense against allegations of copyright infringement, you can still be sued even if your work fits the criteria</strong></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Part 2: Trade Secrets</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is a Trade Secret?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Any secret that gives the holder a measurable business advantage</li>
						<li class="fragment">Can take the form of material things like code or tools, or more ephemeral things such as business processes and organizational systems</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>[Hyacinth gets on their anarchist soap box for a bit]</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What kinds of information can be trade secrets?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Specific details of deals/partnerships</li>
						<li class="fragment">Tools, methodologies, code, schematics</li>
						<li class="fragment">Business contact lists</li>
						<li class="fragment">Etc.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What does having a trade secret entail?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">There are few explicit modes of codifying trade secrets</li>
						<li class="fragment">However, you need to make structural operational security considerations to ensure your secret(s) stay secret</li>
						<li class="fragment">These only get more intense as your organization grows</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Homework</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Look up a copyright dispute in the games industry</li>
						<li class="fragment">Write a synopsis of it including all major information</li>
					</ul>
